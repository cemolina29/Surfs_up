June had a minimum temperature of 64°F while December had a minimum of 56°F. The difference being only 9°F is not a stark difference in how cold it can be in Oahu.


## Summary

The temperature seems to be more variable in December it can be said that the temperature along the whole year is very estable with max and min values, also the chances of continuous rainfall are low so this will tell W. Avy that the Oauh island is a warm place to open a Surf and Ice cream shop. The precipitacion numbers are looking good the shop could be a success.
